<h1>Geospatial Analysis of Urban Growth Dynamics and Land Surface Temperature in Lagos, Nigeria</h1>
        
<p>I did this project for remote sensing. The maps titled "Land use classification 2002 and 2020 shows how land is being used and distributed, while land reclamation map shows areas that were water in 2002 but aready developed in 2020.  Land surface temperature was also visualized because as areas are being developed, higher solar radiation is obtained through greater thermal conductivity</p>
