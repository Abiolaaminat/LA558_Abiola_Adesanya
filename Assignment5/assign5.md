# Developing a Web-Based Historic Places Map: A Tool for Promoting Historic Preservation and Tourism

## Abstract
Historic landmarks and monuments are an important part of our cultural heritage, but they can be difficult to discover and learn about. To promote historic preservation and tourism, there is a need for tools that help people discover and explore historic places in their communities. This project aims to develop a web-based historic places map that provides users with a visual representation of the historic landmarks and monuments in Iowa State. The map will be created using data from historic preservation organizations, government agencies, and museums. The tool will allow users to explore and interact with data, including photographs. The goal of this project is to promote historic preservation, tourism, and education by providing an interactive tool for discovering and learning about historic places in Iowa State.

## Overview
Historic preservation is a dialogue with the past about our future (U.S Department of Interior, n.d). The practice of historic preservation allows for fresh perspectives, insights, and questions to be asked of the past. The practice of historic preservation allows for fresh perspectives, insights, and questions to be asked of the past. A historic places map helps people discover and learn about historic landmarks and monuments in a particular area. Thus, this project intends to create an interactive map that will be created using data from various sources such as historic preservation organizations, government agencies, and museums. It will include information about buildings, sites, monuments, and landscapes that are significant because of their architectural, cultural, or historical value. The map will be accessed through Tableau that allows users to explore and interact with the data. For example, users could click on a particular city to see detailed information about the historic places located there and click on the points from the Map to read about each individual historic property. The purpose of a historic places map is to promote historic preservation, tourism, and education. By providing an interactive tool for discovering and learning about historic places in a particular area, the map can help foster a sense of community and identity among residents and visitors. It can also help raise awareness about the importance of preserving historic landmarks and monuments for future generations.

## Technology
Tableau, QGIS, ArcGIS Pro

## Data
National preservation data, shape files

## Inspiration
My historic preservation class in Fall 2021 inspired this project.

## Potential Challenges
The challenge I am seeing right now is with the data set.

## Timeline
Because I am very skeptical about data availability, I intend to start this weekend. So my proposed timeline is:
Data gathering & cleaning: 04/01 – 04/08 
Analysis & Visualizations: 04/09 – 04/23
Preliminary review: 04/24- 04/27
Final submission: 04/31
