<h1>Minnehaha Park, Minneapolis</h1>
      
<p>This a map that shows the location of Minnehaha Park, one of my fovourites spots in Minnesota during the Summer. It was bought by the State of Minnesota in 1889, and it was one of the early parks in the United States. It is a fun place to be and it has several features and amenities such as bandstand, biking and walking paths, fountain, disc golf course, garden, picnic area, volley ball court, public art, and wading pool, among others.</p>

<h1>The second map shows the 2021-2022 Spatial Distribution of Students' of Color Enrollment in the state of Iowa.</h1>
        
<p>To achieve this, I created a connection with ArcGIS REST Servers from QGIS to get the Iowa Public School District Boundary shapefile, then downloaded the .csv file that shows the 2021-2022 Iowa Public School District PreK-12 Enrollments by District, Race and Gender. I cleaned the data to only show my interested variables and did some calculations to obtain the total number of students of color. Then, imported the cleaned .csv file to QGIS. I used the "join tool" to join both the feature class and the standalone tables. I then used the "calculate field tool" to correct improper spring characters and calculated students of color enrollment percentage. After that, I used my percentage coloumn to symbolize the distribution of srudents of color. The analysis revealed that Priarie Lakes, Northwest AEA, Keystone AEA, and Mississippi Bend AEA had the highest number students' of color enrollment. They are highlighted in blue.</p>

<h1>Map Showing Population Distribution in the State of Iowa</h1>
        
For the third map, I created a map that shows the shows how the population in Iowa is being distributed. The analysis showed Polk county (highlighted in red) to be the county with the highest population. This could be attributed to the fact that more cities are located in the county. I then used the GIS2Web plugin to create a webmap<p>.
