## Minnehaha Parks
[This a map that shows the location of Minnehaha Park, one of my favourites spots in Minnesota during the Summer. It was bought by the state of Minnesota in 1889, and it is one of the early state parks in the United States. It is a fun place to be with several features and amenities such as bandstand, biking path, decorative fountain, garden, volley ball court, wading pool, and walking path, among others.](Assignment/Assignment1/3a_osm.html)
