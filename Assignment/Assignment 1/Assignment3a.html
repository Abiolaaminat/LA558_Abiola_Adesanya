        <h1>Minnehaha Park, Minneapolis</h1>
      
        <p>This a map that shows the location of Minnehaha Park, one of my fovourites spots in Minnesota during the Summer. It was bought by the State of Minnesota in 1889, and it was one of the early parks in the United States. It is a fun place to be and it has several features and amenities such as bandstand, biking and walking paths, fountain, disc golf course, garden, picnic area, volley ball court, public art, and wading pool, among others.</p>
